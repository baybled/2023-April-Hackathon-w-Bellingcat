Voted no.1 to most likely be team.
Had at least 1 nap during this.

## Tool Description
This tool is just to help people who are blind and even those, like me, who are face-blind. I won't call it BimEyes if you don't.

## Installation
This section includes detailed instructions for installing the tool, including any terminal commands that need to be executed and dependencies that need to be installed. Instructions should be understandable by non-technical users (e.g. someone who knows how to open a terminal and run commands, but isn't necessarily a programmer), for example:

1. Make sure you have Python version 3.8 or greater installed

2. Download the tool's repository using the command:

        git clone https://github.com/bellingcat/hackathon-submission-template.git

3. Move to the tool's directory and install the tool

        cd hackathon-submission-template
        pip install .

## Usage
Surf the waves of the internet super highway

## Additional Information
This tool is available under the MIT license, feel free to remix it. 
It was done on very little sanity where I really wanted more naps.
